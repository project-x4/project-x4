### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**project-x4/project-x4** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
I can use GitHub:
1. Storing and sharing code: GitHub can be used to store and share code related to medical research projects. This can help researchers collaborate with each other and work more efficiently.
2. Automating development workflows: GitHub Actions can be used to automate software development workflows, which can save time and reduce errors.
3. Accessing open-source medical foundation models and code: GitHub hosts several repositories of open-source medical foundation models and code, such as the Medical AI Research Foundations repository. Researchers and developers can use these resources to accelerate their medical AI research.
4. Contributing to open-source healthcare software: GitHub hosts several repositories of open-source healthcare software, libraries, tools, and resources. Medical researchers can contribute to these projects to help improve healthcare technology.
Overall, GitHub can be a valuable tool for medical researchers to collaborate, store and share code, and automate development workflows.
